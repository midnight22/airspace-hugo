       developmental delays by giving parents, community health workers, and
       early child development staff the motivation and ability to access
       interventions and augmentative services so that children with developmental
       disabilities and delays can achieve the best possible development outcomes."

      content : "Identify and Escalate


      We can help children thrive by providing:

     - Early identification of childhood disorders.

    - Communication guidelines for health workers around childhood disabilities and risks.

    - Information about knowledge-based intervention for families around the needs of the child.

    Surveillance and monitoring of high-risk children who do not meet diagnostic criteria.

    Appropriate referral to diagnostic centers and intervention services.

    Family enablement to care and advocate for their child.

    Reduced stigma."

      content : "The Ingane Health app aims to improve the rate of detection of children with delayed development
      in a way that is easier to use and more effective than current screening tools. The application gives
      child and youth care workers updatable user-friendly tools in an easy to understand format for improved
      identification of at-risk children, as well as a means to find the closest clinics, mental health or
      other special needs facilities.

      The screen takes approximately 5 minutes to complete, was designed to be used by laypersons with low
      literacy and is free of cultural bias. It has excellent sensitivity and specificity and is appropriate
      to use for children aged 0-6 years."

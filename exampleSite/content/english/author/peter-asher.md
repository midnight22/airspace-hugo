I believe that my work is meaningful when it results in lasting, positive impact that helps others achieve their goals.

I ensure my results are durable and high-yield by understanding the problem and its environment, identifying simple and effective options, collaboratively forming a plan, and implementing changes with attention to detail.

I increase efficacy, reduce complexity, and create built-to-last solutions as a Backend/Infrastructure Engineer, Agile Coach, and Technical Interview Trainer.
